JSHack
========

JS Hack was built by myself ([bcoe](https://github.com/bcoe)) and [dreed1](https://github.com/dreed1) during one of our hack days at [Attachments.me](http://attachments.me).

JSHack is a multiplayer game that tests your real-world JavaScript skills:

* It runs a full-featured JavaScript interpreter in a sandboxed environment.
* It's built completely in Node.js using the Express framework.
* It's tightly integrated with Github using  [everyauth]https://github.com/bnoguchi/everyauth/

You can see it running here: https://attachments.me/hirehack/public/computer.html

I don't have anytime to maintain or update this game, so I've decided to open source it. I'd love to see what kinds of other challenges and features people can add to it.
